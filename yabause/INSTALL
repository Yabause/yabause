Yabause is a Sega Saturn emulator under GNU GPL.
This file will only provide info about generic instructions.

Since yabause 0.9.13 configure-build system are Cmake only.

On main site download a precompiled binary for your platform.

Install binary files
====================

* Linux: many distros have packages, if u have a binary, just run
* Dreamcast: need a disk burn process, see README.DC for details
* Mac OSX: just unzip and see the .app (intel only), see README.MAC for more
* M$cosoft: just unzip and lauch the exe, see README.MS for more
* Androit: see store for apk (modern only), see README.AN for olders and info

Cmake build system
==================

For compiling u must need cmake 2.8.0 as minimum
Requerimients are documented in individual README files.

For installation/how to use information, check the ports
specific README files:

  * README.DC for the dreamcast port
  * README.LIN for the linux port
  * README.MAC for the mac port
  * README.WIN for the m$ocosoft port
  * README.AN for the androit port

Options to parse to cmake
-------------------------

Build flavors options:

-DYAB_MULTIBUID=TRUE/FALSE build all posible flavors (gtk/qt/androit/runner) (FALSE)
-DYAB_USE_QT5=ON/OFF use qt5 or qt4 if both are installed (ON)

Build emulation options:

-DYAB_WANT_OPENSL=OFF/ON build with opengl 3.X support (androit modern only) (ON)
-DYAB_WANT_OPENGL=OFF/ON build with opengl only support (desktop modern only) (ON)
-DYAB_WANT_SDL=OFF/ON build with sound SDL cores if available (autodetec SDL1/SDL2)
-DYAB_WANT_OPENAL=OFF/ON build with sound OpenAL cores if available (AUTO)
-DYAB_NETWORK=ON/OFF build networking support (unix related only for now) (ON)

Internal emulation capabilites:

-DYAB_WANT_C68K=ON/OFF use internal c68K compilation build in (ON)
-DYAB_WANT_Q68=ON/OFF use internal q68 compilation build in (OFF)
-DYAB_USE_SCSP2=ON/OFF build with newer scsp implementation (OFF)
-DSH2_DYNAREC=ON/OFF enable SH2 dinarec compiler (ON)
-DSH2_TRACE=ON/OFF enable SH2 tracin (ON)

Compiler related options:

-DYAB_OPTIMIZATION="STRING" parse optimizations from user (-03)
-DSH2_TRACE=ON/OFF enable SH2 tracin (ON)


Notes on building
-----------------------

* If multibuild are not set, depends on tarjet will build gtk, qt5, qt4, runner, androit.
* Qt multimedia package will be autodetected, on debian autodetection are still not performed
* if u set opengl to OFF will build only a software video rasterizer
* Currently software rasterizer still make calls to some opengl api's.
