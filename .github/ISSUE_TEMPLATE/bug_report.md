This repository is home to 3 libretro cores : yabause, Kronos, and yabasanshiro. Your issue will be closed if you don't mention the core you are using.

You should also consider this :
- the yabause project has been dead for years, so don't expect emulation improvements and other fixes of long-term upstream issues, but requests related to libretro-specific issues and features will be considered
- the Kronos libretro core is directly maintained upstream (https://github.com/FCare/Kronos), all issues should be reported there
- the yabasanshiro libretro core is unmaintained, full of bugs, and shouldn't be used, but contributors who are willing to change that status are welcome
